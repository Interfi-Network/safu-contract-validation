# Important Disclaimer
Smart contracts are analyzed for common contract vulnerabilities, and centralization exploits. The audit report makes no statements or warranties on the security of the code. The audit report does not provide any warranty or guarantee regarding the absolute bug-free nature of the smart contract analyzed, nor does it provide any indication of the client’s business, business model or legal compliance. The audit report does not extend to the compiler layer, any other areas beyond the programming language, or other programming aspects that could present security risks. Cryptographic tokens are emergent technologies, they carry high levels of technical risks and uncertainty. You agree that your access and/or use, including but not limited to any services, reports, and materials, will be at your sole risk on an as-is, where-is, and as-available basis. The audit report could include false positives, false negatives, and other unpredictable results.

Smart contract audit does not indicate the endorsement of any particular project or team, nor guarantees its security. No third party should rely on the reports in any way, including to make any decisions to buy or sell a product, service or any other asset.
